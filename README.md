# challenge4_questionnaire_extravaganza

## No starter code supplied for a challenge involvoing a set of questions and answers for a user to respond to in order to end with a generated score based on correct and/or incorrect responses. The user is allowed to enter their initials to capture their score for further viewing later down the road to see if they can top it. User should be able to interact with buttons to start the game, answer questions, and end the game by entering their intials.

### This Challenge was hard and none of it could not have been accomplished without the masterful help of of class leader and instructor, Robbert. Kudos to him for pushing me and guiding my brain in the right direction for completion of this challenge, which would not have been accomplished without him.
